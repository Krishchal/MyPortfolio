IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT RESUME FILE

Since this is a GitHub Pages deployment, you'll need to manually add your resume PDF file:

1. Create a folder named "assets/resume" in your repository if it doesn't exist
2. Upload your resume PDF file to this folder
3. Name the file "Krishchal_Regmi_Resume.pdf" to match the download link in the HTML

The resume download button in the bottom-right corner of the website is already configured to link to this file location.

If you want to use a different filename, make sure to update the href attribute in the HTML:
<a href="assets/resume/YOUR_FILENAME.pdf" download="YOUR_FILENAME.pdf" class="btn download-btn">
